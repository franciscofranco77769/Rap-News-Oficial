<h4>My mother warned me that some nigga's ain't my right hand</h4>
<h4>To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man</h4>
<h4>His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props</h4>
<h4>He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop</h4>
<h4>So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact</h4>
<h4>That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back</h4>
<h4>The streets are filled with some clues, like how I ain't notice that?</h4>
<h4>(How I ain't see that?)</h4>
<h4>Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuff in the culdesac</h4>
<h4>I pull up, get out, what up?</h4>
<h4>I wanna help, but what you want for some</h4>
<h4>Some niggas really don't want for themself</h4>
<h4>Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma</h4>
<h4>And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt)</h4>
<h4>So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awk-</h4>
<h4>-ward, and I heard through some words that you off it</h4>
<h4>I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path</h4>
<h4>And crash and get distracted</h4>
<h4>But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain</h4>
<h4>Keep my windshield wipers prepared 'cause y'all threw so much shade</h4>
<h4>And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front</h4>
<h4>I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump</h4>
<h4>Just let me know, my nigga</h4>
<h4>I had to switch the gears on 'em</h4>
<h4>Fishtail in the rearview mir' on 'em (Skrrt!)</h4>
<h4>I had to switch gears on 'em</h4>
<h4>You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em</h4>
<h4>Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Snakes in the grass, but I walk</h4>
<h4>I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF</h4>
<h4>So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk</h4>
<h4>I left the condom in the grass so fuck off</h4>
<h4>Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it</h4>
<h4>Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted</h4>
<h4>I draw my piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'</h4>
<h4>The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon</h4>
<h4>Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry</h4>
<h4>Oh he lonely</h4>
<h4>All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies</h4>
<h4>All I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things</h4>
<h4>That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please</h4>
<h4>Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf</h4>
<h4>Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool</h4>
<h4>Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool</h4>
<h4>Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself than fuck with their fleece</h4>
<h4>See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw</h4>
<h4>Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?</h4>
<h4>One day, "Fuck no, " the next day, "Okay"</h4>
<h4>But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four</h4>
<h4>I just want that garden and that Batmobile</h4>
<h4>Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile</h4>
<h4>Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards</h4>
<h4>But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles</h4>
<h4>I keep it pushin', nigga</h4>
<h4>I had to switch gears on 'em</h4>
<h4>Fishtail in the rearview mir' on 'em (Skrrt!)</h4>
<h4>I had to switch gears on 'em</h4>
<h4>You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em</h4>
<h4>Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole</h4>
<h4>Fuck, okay, next one</h4>
<h4>Gotta watch out for the potholes</h4>
<h4>Said watch out for the potholes</h4>
