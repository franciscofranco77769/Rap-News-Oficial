<h4>Okay, okay, okay, okay</h4>
<h4>Okay, okay, oh</h4>
<h4>You live in my dream state</h4>
<h4>We're lowkey my fantasy</h4>
<h4>I stay in reality</h4>
<h4>You live in my dream state</h4>
<h4>Any time I count sheep</h4>
<h4>That's the only time we make up, make up</h4>
<h4>You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids</h4>
<h4>Now I don't wanna wake up</h4>
<h4>20/20, 20/20 vision</h4>
<h4>Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision</h4>
<h4>I wonder if you look both ways</h4>
<h4>When you cross my mind, I said, I said</h4>
<h4>I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing</h4>
<h4>You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I</h4>
<h4>I can only see your face when I close my eyes</h4>
<h4>Can I get a kiss?</h4>
<h4>And can you make it last forever?</h4>
<h4>I said I'm 'bout to go to war</h4>
<h4>I don't know if I'ma see you again</h4>
<h4>Can I get a kiss? (Can I)</h4>
<h4>And can you make it last forever? (Can you)</h4>

<h4>I said, okay, okay, okay, okidokie, my infatuation</h4>
<h4>Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? Love</h4>
<h4>Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you</h4>
<h4>I've been looking, stuck here waiting for I</h4>
<h4>Stop the chasing, like an alcoholic</h4>
<h4>You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?</h4>
<h4>It's them rose to the cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes</h4>
<h4>Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene</h4>
<h4>Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie</h4>
<h4>Yugh!</h4>
