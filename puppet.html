<h4>Ayo</h4>
<h4>I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk</h4>
<h4>I wanna walk to your front door and knock</h4>
<h4>After I stop</h4>
<h4>My vehicle drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart</h4>
<h4>Land at your driveway and put it in park</h4>
<h4>Then do the third line of this verse</h4>
<h4>Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes</h4>
<h4>And we ride through the park, chase the sun</h4>
<h4>'Cause that's all I want, other than air</h4>
<h4>Oxygen, air, financial freedom, yeah</h4>
<h4>I want your company, I need your company</h4>
<h4>I want you to want for me, I can't maneuver</h4>
<h4>Without you next to me</h4>
<h4>It's so complex to me</h4>
<h4>What do you need?</h4>
<h4>Do you need bread? Do you need this?</h4>
<h4>Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?</h4>
<h4>I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead</h4>
<h4>What is your wish? It can be granted</h4>
<h4>You're number one, one on my list</h4>
<h4>To you I'm Santa, Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic</h4>
<h4>I do not have self control</h4>
<h4>I am startin' to wonder</h4>
<h4>Is this my free will or yours?</h4>
<h4>(Yours, yours, yours)</h4>
<h4>I'm your puppet</h4>
<h4>You control me</h4>
<h4>I'm your puppet</h4>
<h4>I don't know me</h4>
<h4>(Did I wait too long?) I'm your puppet</h4>
<h4>(Did I wait too long?) You control me</h4>
<h4>(Did I wait too long?) I'm your puppet</h4>
<h4>(Did I wait too long?) I don't know me</h4>
<h4>'Cause I'm your puppet (puppet, oh)</h4>
<h4>You control me (control me)</h4>
<h4>I'm your puppet (puppet)</h4>
<h4>I don't know (ooh ah)</h4>
<h4>I'm your puppet</h4>
<h4>(Did I wait too long?) Ohh</h4>
<h4>Woah, oh, oh (puppet)</h4>
<h4>You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me</h4>
<h4>Ay, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see</h4>
<h4>A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe</h4>
<h4>Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breather</h4>
<h4>On a cedar</h4>
<h4>On a wee verse</h4>
<h4>Light the weed first</h4>
<h4>Blowin' reefers, get the reverse (yeah we 'bout to scream, yeah we 'bout to scream)</h4>
<h4>Get the weed (yeah we 'bout to scream, oh lord)</h4>
<h4>Breathe on a song</h4>
<h4>(La, la, la) Breathe on a song</h4>
<h4>(La, la, la, la, la, la) Breathe on a song</h4>
<h4>(I've been lost)</h4>
<h4>But at some point, you come to your senses</h4>
