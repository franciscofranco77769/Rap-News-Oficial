<h4>Comparing scars before dinner</h4>
<h4>Jump off the booth into the mirror</h4>
<h4>Felt like summer</h4>
<h4>To my December</h4>
<h4>Was it my August?</h4>
<h4>Shit, I don't remember</h4>
<h4>(Two, three, go)</h4>
<h4>I know my temperature was set</h4>
<h4>You finally flew south</h4>
<h4>The bird gon' leave the nest, it's so comedic</h4>
<h4>At least I had it (uh)</h4>
<h4>Instead of never</h4>
<h4>Or maybe I'm too dramatic</h4>
<h4>(Two, three, go)</h4>
<h4>Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, my love's gone</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, oh, gone (two, three, go)</h4>
<h4>Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, my love's gone</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, gone</h4>
<h4>Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone</h4>
<h4>I know love is all I got</h4>
<h4>I just hope to God she got good taste</h4>
<h4>Could put you on some shit you never seen</h4>
<h4>Could play a couple songs that you could dance to</h4>
<h4>I hope you know she can't compete with me</h4>
<h4>Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, my love's gone</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, oh, gone</h4>
<h4>Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, my love's gone</h4>
<h4>My love's gone, gone</h4>
<h4>Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)</h4>
<h4>Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)</h4>
<h4>Keep it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (Going)</h4>
<h4>And now I'm scarred for life</h4>
<h4>My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)</h4>
<h4>My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone</h4>
<h4>Ayo, there's poison in that gumbo</h4>
<h4>Emotion for Dumbo</h4>
<h4>Ask me where my luck go</h4>
<h4>That bitch walked outside the front door</h4>
<h4>Knock, knock, knock, knock</h4>
<h4>I'm not shocked, I brought this on me</h4>
<h4>It's my fault, you gon' leave</h4>
<h4>Lesser talk, see the</h4>
<h4>Weatherman told me it wasn't raining</h4>
<h4>My stupid ass brought an umbrellas</h4>
<h4>I got a glimpse of your cloud and feel better</h4>
<h4>Now it's ninety degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve</h4>
<h4>Is drenched in sweat and illusion because I jet to conclusion</h4>
<h4>You got your thing, I got nothing, but memories</h4>
<h4>I know your secrets, nigga</h4>
<h4>I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that</h4>
<h4>Everybody making a choice according to plan and</h4>
<h4>We had two different blueprints, but understood her fluent</h4>
<h4>She opened up early on, I thought I had a permit</h4>
<h4>You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence</h4>
<h4>Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant</h4>
<h4>I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease</h4>
<h4>You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it</h4>
<h4>But I finally found peace, so peace</h4>
<h4>Lemme do it over</h4>
<h4>(Where? Everything)</h4>
<h4>I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit</h4>
<h4>It really does, it crushes your soul</h4>
<h4>Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy</h4>
<h4>But I will never want to fall in love again</h4>
<h4>Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh</h4>
<h4>But I don't ever want to fall in love again</h4>
<h4>I said go, go</h4>
<h4>Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy</h4>
<h4>But I will never want to fall in love again (Again)</h4>
<h4>Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh</h4>
<h4>But I don't ever want to fall in love again</h4>
<h4>Again, again</h4>
<h4>Again, again, again, again, again, again</h4>
<h4>(Got my eye)</h4>
