<h4>I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck</h4>
<h4>Old lonely ass nigga (I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck)</h4>
<h4>Need to go somewhere and get some bitches or something</h4>
<h4>Weird ass nigga</h4>
<h4>I can't even lie, I've been</h4>
<h4>Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely</h4>
<h4>They say the loudest in the room is weak</h4>
<h4>That's what they assume, but I disagree</h4>
<h4>I say the loudest in the room</h4>
<h4>Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)</h4>
<h4>Attention seeker, public speaker</h4>
<h4>Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely</h4>
<h4>Writin' songs about these people</h4>
<h4>Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony</h4>
<h4>One thing I know, is that I wanna</h4>
<h4>Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago</h4>
<h4>Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low</h4>
<h4>You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo</h4>
<h4>From the start it's been real dark</h4>
<h4>It's been so dark I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh</h4>
<h4>I'm playin' like Hasbro</h4>
<h4>I'm really Saari, call me Arto</h4>
<h4>Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla</h4>
<h4>I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)</h4>
<h4>But what the fuck else do you want from me?</h4>
<h4>That is the only thing keepin' me company</h4>
<h4>Purchase some things until I'm annoyed</h4>
<h4>These items is fillin' the void</h4>
<h4>Been fillin' it for so long</h4>
<h4>I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)</h4>
<h4>Current battle as an adult</h4>
<h4>My partner is a shadow</h4>
<h4>I need love, do you got some I could borrow?</h4>
<h4>Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow</h4>
<h4>Woah, but that never comes</h4>
<h4>Like a vasectomy, what have I done?</h4>
<h4>I got the talent, the face and the funds</h4>
<h4>Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)</h4>
<h4>Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)</h4>
<h4>The loneliest of them all (me)</h4>
<h4>Cupid actin' stupid</h4>
<h4>Do you got another number I could call?</h4>
<h4>Never had a pet</h4>
<h4>I've never had a pet</h4>
<h4>There's more fish in the sea</h4>
<h4>But I never had a goldfish to begin with</h4>
<h4>I never had a dog</h4>
<h4>So I've never been good with bitches</h4>
<h4>'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch</h4>
<h4>I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet</h4>
<h4>Treat me like direct deposit</h4>
<h4>Check in on me sometime</h4>
<h4>Ask me how I'm really doin'</h4>
<h4>So I never have to press that nine-one-one</h4>
<h4>Oh! Damn! Damn!</h4>
