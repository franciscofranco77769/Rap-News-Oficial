<h4>Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window</h4>
<h4>Woo</h4>
<h4>I saw a photo, you looked joyous</h4>
<h4>My eyes are green, I eat my veggies</h4>
<h4>I need to get her out the picture</h4>
<h4>She's really fuckin' up my frame</h4>
<h4>She's not developed like we are</h4>
<h4>Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone</h4>
<h4>New magic, new magic, new magic wand</h4>
<h4>Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (nigga)</h4>
<h4>New magic, new magic, new magic wand</h4>
<h4>My brother said I'm on the spectrum</h4>
<h4>Don't call me selfish, I ain't sharin'</h4>
<h4>This 60-40 (isn't) workin'</h4>
<h4>I want a hundred of your time, you're mine</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now (Don't leave) (Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave) (New magic, new magic, new magic wand)</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now (Don't leave) (Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)</h4>
<h4>Please don't leave me now (New magic, new magic, new magic wand)</h4>
<h4>I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)</h4>
<h4>You wanna be mean, mixed signals don't park (I can make her leave)</h4>
<h4>She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)</h4>
<h4>We can finally be together</h4>
<h4>You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right</h4>
<h4>Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?</h4>
<h4>Your other one evaporate, we celebrate</h4>
<h4>You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't</h4>
<h4>I'll pick you both (Run, run, run, run)</h4>
<h4>(Run, run, run, run) It's not a joke</h4>
<h4>Murder she wrote</h4>
<h4>Ayo</h4>
<h4>Take one look in the mirror, implications so clear</h4>
<h4>I live life with no fear, except for the idea</h4>
<h4>That one day you won't be here</h4>
<h4>I will not fetch the ball</h4>
<h4>Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables</h4>
<h4>It has nothin' to do with that broad</h4>
<h4>But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well</h4>
<h4>I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen</h4>
<h4>If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym</h4>
<h4>Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest</h4>
<h4>That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them</h4>
<h4>Can't be in the picture if it got no frame</h4>
<h4>Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame</h4>
<h4>Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't</h4>
<h4>I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one</h4>
<h4>Not the other one, keep it on the low</h4>
<h4>I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high</h4>
<h4>Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em</h4>
<h4>Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store</h4>
<h4>Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door</h4>
<h4>Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned</h4>
<h4>New magic wand</h4>
